>"Abondon All Hope Thee Who Enters"

A malware dev enthusiast mainly interested on low level stuff, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, rootkits, drivers nd a lot more 
# 👾 Who Am I?

Just another curious mind wandering through the machine.

I break things to understand how they work from binaries and memory layouts to entire systems. Whether it's kernel internals, low-level exploits, or writing clean code that reads like poetry, I live for the deep dive.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🧩 Reverse engineer stuff (for educational purposes)
- 🐚 Build tools in C, Rust, and Python
- 🧵 Write PoCs for injection, hooking, and stealth techniques
- 🔍 Tear apart malware samples
- 🎯 Practice on Hack The Box and CTF platforms

## 🌌 Why I Do It

Because knowledge is power.  
Because curiosity is unstoppable.  
Because 0s and 1s are more honest than people.
and mainly to help ppl with things i found hard 

## 🌱 Always Learning

I’m currently:

- Crafting the Ultimate malware loader with tons of features
- Building my own kernel-mode cheats for fun  
- Diving deeper into Windows internals
